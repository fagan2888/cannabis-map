# cannabis-map

cannabis-map is a data visualization web app using Dash, Python, and Pandas to analize official Colorado cannabis business data.
App may be toggled from the map page, which shows all licensed cannabis businesses in Colorado, and basic information about each 
business upon hovering on location, to a revenue page, which shows total annual revenue by county.  The revenue page also 
features a map which graphically displays revenue per capita in each county where cannabis sales are legal.
